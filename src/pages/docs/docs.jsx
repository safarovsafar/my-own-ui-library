      <p className='text-[25px] font-semibold'>Introduction</p>
      <p className='mt-5 text-xl '>CUI is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.</p>
      <p className='mt-[100px] text-xl font-bold'>This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.</p>
      <p className='mt-7 text-xl'>You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.</p>
      <p className='mt-7 text-xl'>This approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isnâ€™t included in the library. Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.</p>

      <p className='mt-7 text-xl'>This is what shadcn/ui aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:</p>

      <li className='mt-7'> Open Code: The top layer of your component code is open for modification.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'>Composition: Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'>AI-Ready: Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'>Beautiful Defaults: Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.</li>
      <li className='mt-3'>Distribution: A flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.</li>

        <p className='mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold'>Every component in shadcn/ui shares a common, composable interface. If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.</p>
        <p className='mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold'>A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones.</p>
